"""
Food pairing modifiers applied to attribute scores.

Keys are backend IDs (snake_case). The frontend maps UI labels → backend IDs
before sending them to the API.

Structure per pairing:
  is_sweet_pairing — True triggers Palate Paradox detection for dry-preferring users
  congruent        — multipliers/boosts that mirror the dish's dominant character
  contrast         — multipliers/boosts that create balance against the dish

Formula applied per attribute (regardless of mode):
  final_attribute = (base_score * multiplier) + boost

Pairing philosophy:
  congruent  — "Match the dish." Find a wine that echoes the food's character.
               Rich food → rich wine. Acidic dish → high-acid wine.
  contrast   — "Balance the dish." Find a wine that cuts against the food.
               Rich food → crisp wine to slice through fat.
               Delicate food → expressive wine to frame it.

Cellar Fox's Logic (the reasoning behind each entry):
  red_meat     — congruent: structure meets richness. contrast: acid cuts fat.
  poultry      — congruent: delicate meets delicate. contrast: expressive frames the bird.
  white_fish   — congruent: bright and clean. contrast: textured and expressive (tannin still off-limits).
  rich_fish    — congruent: freshness balances oily flesh. contrast: body matches body.
  spicy_food   — congruent: cool and soothe the heat. contrast: amplify the fire.
  tomato_sauce — congruent: acid meets acid. contrast: smooth rounds out the tang.
  creamy_sauce — congruent: body matches dairy. contrast: acid cuts the fat.
  greens       — congruent: bright mirrors fresh. contrast: earthy complements vegetal.
  charcuterie  — congruent: balanced all-rounder. contrast: acid cuts salt and fat.
  none         — palate dial stays exactly where the user set it.
